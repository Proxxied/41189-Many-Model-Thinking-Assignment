    "Social media platforms are growing at an alarming rate, and with the current global pandemic, most jobs and social interactions have been pushed onto an online environment, leading to a surgical increase in online user activity within the past couple of months. This increase in online activity has without a doubt placed a substantial load on such platforms as these businesses have had to deal with an explosion of user activity within a short period of time, affecting the overall productivity of business and consumer relations. Social media platforms like Tiktok and Instagram both have their fair share of public prevalence, however recently blew up in popularity due to COVID-19 as a means of staying connected with friends and loved-ones to reduce both isolation and boredom. Other applications like Zoom and Microsoft Teams have also gained significance, which has recently caused performance issues dealing with the heavy loads of meetings and varying chat rooms that were created as a result of attempting to be connected. To combat with the performance and productivity issues, it is fundamental to understand and identify key attributes that correlate to this growth through the modelling of system dynamic models, networks, and replicator dynamic models in order to best support said businesses through these tough times of need.

System dynamics, networks and replicator dynamic models will further assist in identifying the appropriate actions required in order to rapidly support a global, online ecosystem of major brands to build a community of individuals, to identify strategic feedback loops, and understanding how people react to new, unfamiliar platforms from a realistic and mathematical point of view. By supporting these businesses, it can ensure that such social media platforms stay online and active, which is evermore important during these despite times of need, whereby such physical social interactions remain constricted and limited, and by conducting this investigation, it will without a doubt secure an online webspace for the uncertain future."

    "Within the social media industry, companies such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom have substantially increased in user activity within the recent months, most notably when the world paused its global productivity at the beginning of this year. Zoom in particular, was forced to expand their servers in various countries in order to keep up with the demands of the industry, increasing from 10 million daily meeting participants in December of 2019, to surpassing 300 million daily meeting participants in April of 2020 (Warren, 2020). However by doing so, Zoom also introduced risk factors such as security and privacy concerns related to the platform. The company responded with continuous updates to the application which not only addresses the aforementioned security and privacy issues, but also, according to The Verge, will be releasing version 5.0, which *“includes passwords by default, improved encryption, and a new security icon to control meetings.”* This update is the resulting outcome of the social media platform’s exponential growth, influenced by the increased numbers of taxpayers working from home due to the pandemic."

Discord will implement this feature, knowing that it will create performance instabilities and potential latency issues, yet this action directly creates a learning space for academics including schools and universities at a global scale which will undeniably allow Discord as a platform to further grow and essentially take advantage of the ‘learning at home’ situation that students and teachers currently face.

    "The major increase of engagement of social media platforms due to the automation of the future has allowed an opportunity for many models to address certain issues. Network models highlight the intercorrelation between two entities and how information is transferred to establish connections with one another. Social media platforms utilise network models through the online environment to create connections with peers and friends. Furthermore, social media growth can be measured through network models and the main types of network models. For example, small worlds demonstrate the connections and relationships between small groups of peers or community by the utilisation of social media platforms which provide additional support to establish small group chats and relationships. Furthermore, the high user engagement of online software’s and apps have been increased exponentially due to the corona virus pandemic. Therefore, social media platforms must deal with high user engagement to maintain a working information system. Moreover, social media platforms provide a crucial impact towards the marketing and advertising environment as it allows the promotion of products towards the consumers of social media. The replicator dynamic model suggests the adoption of strategy that is most likely to be chosen by the agent. The replicator dynamic model demonstrates the social media platform engagement of new users as most of the population with access to internet adapt the social media strategy."

Undeniably, social media platforms have major issues with maintenance and the constant need for website patches/bugs. However, socially due to the pandemic, territorial restrictions to physical gatherings have created an opportunity for social media platforms to engage in solving this issue. Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram all provide entertainment services for those stuck at home due to the restrictions. Big data refers to a high-volume amount of data that can be structured or even unstructured that need to be given meaning. Social media platforms deal with big data daily as there are large amounts of consumers daily. Furthermore, social media platforms provide educational purposes which is a significant benefit towards online schooling due to the corona virus pandemic. Models of social media can be demonstrated through social interaction and online interaction as they have their similarities and differences. Complex systems are related to social interactions and modelling such interactions can be difficult in nature."

The quantitative data on the social media platform would be numbers such as amount of users. To gather qualitative data, a common and effective technique is interviewing stakeholders especially when creating the concept of the model. For the quantitative data it is generally sourced from the existing social media system as they should have access to the number of users on the platform but can also be further collected through methods such as survey and polls.

This scenario in particular simulates the fact that when a new social media platform is introduced, it grows at a rapid pace rather than the previous scenario, impacting the overall future succession of the platform as a whole. The network represents varying attributes of both strong and weak ties between individuals (degrees) in the network, alluding that this scenario allows additional connections between said users. For instance, degree(1) has strong communicative connections between five different individuals, including that of degree(0), degree(2), degree(4), degree(6), and degree(9). This provides additional growth for the social media platform in question, with individual users in the platform able to expand and communicate their ideas with greater than three separate users of the platform, subsequently leading to further interactions and therefore stronger ties present within the network when compared to the first scenario.\n",

    "#### Scenario 1\n",
    "In this scenario, the overall growth of such new social media platforms is determined by which a percentage of the population of agents / users begin without any social media interaction (in the graph below, this is indicative of the blue line). Given the strategy of, for example with the global pandemic currently happening, over time the percentage of the population of agents who aren't connected to any social media platform will greatly diminish due to the fact that the payoffs and returns are substantially beneficial to the user at the point of which the agent will then adopt a different strategy. In this case, the ability to communicate between friends and family through an online webspace proves to be significant and the highest payoff possible over other strategies (like for example, calling through phone lines). This will then lead to other agents viewing that the payoffs of such strategy is fundamentally beneficial within their personal lifestyles, leading to a great percentage of the population more likely to copy the strategies of the other, which is indicative of the red line within the graph. This is because over time, more and more individuals would see great benefit in having access to a social media platform and will more likely join due to a behavioural factor of potentially missing out on how the world changes and adapts to these platforms. This results in a substantial increase in user activity within a short period of time, due to the fact of people copying other working strategies. \n",

    "#### Scenario 2\n",
    "Another scenario of replicator dynamics is in the rational perspective of the agent in question. Agents will simply adopt the strategy that they see is the best amongst other alternative strategies in terms of prevalence. In this case, if for example there was 40% percent of the population conducting strategy one, which is to be on a social media platform, 50% on strategy two, which is off a platform, and 10% on strategy three, there is a more likely chance that the agent will select strategy two due to its immense prevalence within the given population regardless of the payoff. However in the function of probability, because there are more individuals connected to a social media platform at the time, then more people will follow simply due to the prevalence multiplied by the payoffs. For instance, if on the graph a social media platform has over 200 days of online activity containing to 50 percent of the population, there is a greater chance that agents would select being on the platform (shown as the red line), because of the significant prevalence of said social media in such a period of time. This in turn results in an increase in popularity for these platforms in order to grow and flourish, with the intent of assigning 100 percent of the population to become on the platform.\n"

    "\n",
    "As a system dynamics model is based on feedback loops, a solution that could be implemented would be volunteer funding from content creators from the social media platform. A survey can be sent out to all of their big creators on the platform giving them an option to opt in for funding advertisements for the platform. Through the use of the system dynamics model it will attract the creators as it is also in their best interest to grow the platform as it will increase their following size as well. To encourage creators to donate large amounts of money the social media platform can also offer creators to be within the advertisements itself to promote their page/channel. Due to money/profits being one of the main factors for not investing into advertisements to further growth of the platform, this solution can potentially provide a third party source of income for the platform to use to increase the total number of users and followers for the creators. The key to this solution is the system dynamics model to convince creators of the potential yet eventual benefits. This would be a solution that can be mutually beneficial for both the platform and its creators as it can also be seen as an investment for the creators to increase their following size whilst removing funding commitments for the platform to increase the amount of users."

Originally, I had been editing this file on github itself and eventually bugged out the file which made it unaccessible but luckily my group members had a backup file and knew how to fix it. After that event Evan offered a tutorial on how to use Jupyter Notebook and quickly solved our issues of not being able to edit the file properly. Another challenge that was unique this year was working in a group despite COVID19 stopping us from meeting up at campus. However, this was resolved when we created a group chat on Facebook Messenger which allowed us to communicate at all times collectively as a group. \n",

    "When dealing with a real-world problem that requires modelling to fix I would first gather as much information as possible such as the situation, variables, inputs and outputs. It is important to identify the problem to see the scale of it aswel as well as the elements of it. Once I have gained all the information that is accessible I would look at the list of model options assess the situation once more. If the model is based off understanding the behavioural characteristics of humans then I would use models such as a networking model to explain their decision making and visualise how information is being processed. If the problem at hand included numerical data, distribution models would be my choice as it is able to produce graphs which is favourable with displaying the trend and results of numerical data. Therefore, after gaining information of what the real-world problem is, I would determine which model to use based off which model has the most favourable if not all inputs and outputs to produce a model that will provide the most information."
